    <p class="lead pb-3">We are hardly an year old, yet the kind of events that we
      have held in the Vizag ecosystem has kept us in the hotseats. Our team is
      small, yet the goal of all of us is to make the Vizag eco-system the next
      big developer hub with equal opportunity to women in tech.</p>
    <p class="lead pb-3">
      The success of our events is only due to the unending support of our team
      which comprises of organisers, co-organisers and volunteers all of who
      work in their spare time to make our events as seamless as you see them.
    </p>
    <p class="lead pb-3">
      The first prerequisite to be on the team is to be an attendee and be
      passionate about developer centric technologies. And if you feel you can
      contribute in any way, feel free to fill the volunteer form.</p>
